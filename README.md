# **DSA Final Project:**  


Javascript and Python are the two most popular programming languages. Javascript versality in the web and python's versality across multiple domains have made them a popular choice of language for programmers. There exists some similarities between both languages. Both JavaScript and Python are interpreted languages low level languages and the support multiple modern paradigms of programming like object oriented and functional programming. At a first glance some of the most noticable difference between both language is in namespaces, ndentation, implementation of object oriented programming and the 

According to wikipedia, there are over 700 pogramming languages. With the evolving new programming languages znd sometimes ceasation of support for older ones, programmers have to learn new languages, rewrite codebases in a newer language and handle many other quirks that emanate from changing the langauge a program is written. The aim of this    














Take an expression like this below
```javascript
const x = 3 + 1 * 7;
```
Handling scope
Say a we have two nested functions like this

```javascript
function foo(){
  //outer scope
  
  function bar(){
    //inner scope
  }
}
```
Parsng this into valid syntax in another language would be extremely difficult. Both javascri
